## Counting how many 1-bits

- Given an integer n,  ccomplete the function getOneBits. 
- The function must return a results array with the number of 1's stored  at results[0] followed by the position of all 1's in its binary representation in ascending order

- sample case: 
   sample input: n = 161
   sample output: 3 1 3 8
   explanation: 161 convert to 1010 0001
